/// Keeps folded sections out of the layout without touching a character of the note, and
/// marks the headings that are hiding something.
///
/// The mechanism is `NSTextContentManagerDelegate.shouldEnumerateTextElement`, whose header
/// in the macOS 26.5 SDK says returning NO makes an element "skipped from the enumeration",
/// and whose companion `enumerateTextElementsFromLocation` says an implementation may "hide
/// some elements from the layout". Measured offscreen before this was written: hiding two
/// paragraphs of six took the laid-out fragments from 6 to 4 and the height from 96 to 64;
/// then confirmed on screen in a real editor, which was the part the offscreen stack could
/// not answer.
///
/// Not a zero-width font, which is what collapses the *delimiters* of a line: a `\n` at
/// size 0.01 still breaks the line, so a folded section would be a stack of empty rows.
///
/// The other half of why this mechanism is the right one: the folded lines are not in the
/// layout at all, so `NSTextSelectionNavigation` never walks into them. Arrow-down from the
/// heading lands on the next visible line. Nothing to skip by hand - unlike the zero-width
/// route, where the caret stops twice inside a run that occupies no space.
///
/// Not `@MainActor`: Swift 6 refuses both conformances ("crosses into main actor-isolated
/// code"), so this object holds plain values and is fed from the view.
